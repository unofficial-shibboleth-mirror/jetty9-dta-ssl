/**
 * Builder used to construct {@link HttpClient} objects configured with particular settings.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When using the single-arg constructor variant to wrap an existing instance of
 * {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder}, there are several caveats of which to be aware:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>
 * Instances of the following which are set as the default instance on the Apache builder will be unconditionally
 * overwritten by this builder when {@link #buildClient()} is called:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link RequestConfig}</li>
 * <li>{@link ConnectionConfig}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is due to the unfortunate fact that the Apache builder does not currently provide accessor methods to obtain the
 * default instances currently set on the builder. Therefore, if you need to set any default request or connection
 * config parameters which are not exposed by this builder, then you must use the Apache builder directly and may not
 * use this builder.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * If this builder's <code>connectionDisregardTLSCertificate</code> is set to <code>true</code>, then any value
 * previously set via the Apache builder's
 * {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder#setSSLSocketFactory} will be
 * unconditionally overwritten.</li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * If this builder is supplied with a <code>connectionProxyHost</code>, <code>connectionProxyUsername</code> and
 * <code>connectionProxyPassword</code>, then any value previously set via the Apache builder's
 * {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder#setDefaultCredentialsProvider(CredentialsProvider)} will be
 * unconditionally overwritten.</li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * Per the Apache builder's Javadoc, if a non-null instance of {@link org.apache.http.conn.HttpClientConnectionManager}
 * is set on the Apache builder via
 * {@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder#setConnectionManager},
 * this supersedes various other properties set on the Apache builder. This includes the following
 * instances/properties on the Apache builder:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>SSLSocketFactory</code> ({@link org.apache.http.conn.socket.LayeredConnectionSocketFactory})</li>
 * <li>{@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.http.conn.ssl.X509HostnameVerifier}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.http.config.SocketConfig}</li>
 * <li>{@link ConnectionConfig}</li>
 * <li><code>maxConnTotal</code></li>
 * <li><code>maxConnPerRoute</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Similarly, the following setters on this builder will become ineffective when a non-null connection manger is set on
 * the Apache builder:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setTLSSocketFactory(LayeredConnectionSocketFactory)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setConnectionDisregardTLSCertificate(boolean)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setSocketBufferSize(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setHttpContentCharSet(String)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setMaxConnectionsTotal(int)}</li>
 * <li>{@link #setMaxConnectionsPerRoute(int)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Therefore, if you need to explicitly supply a connection manager instance to the Apache builder (for example in order
 * to be able to use {@link IdleConnectionSweeper}), then you must supply these properties or instances directly to the
 * connection manager rather than to this builder or the Apache builder.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * Similar to the above issue, setting an explicit <code>SSLSocketFactory</code> on the Apache builder will supersede
 * the following Apache builder properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link javax.net.ssl.SSLContext}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.http.conn.ssl.X509HostnameVerifier}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * </p>
