/**
 * A collection of methods supporting test class execution.
 *
 * Methods named <code>isJavaV</code><i>x</i><code>OrLater</code>
 * are for use by tests needing to vary what they test, or the results
 * they expect, depending on the version of Java under which the test
 * is executing.
 *
 * For example, code which behaves differently depending on the presence
 * of cryptographic algorithms only available from some specific version of
 * the Java platform may be gated by such a method. <i>The code under test
 * should instead operate on the basis of the presence or absence of the
 * algorithm in question.</i>
 *
 * The API provided for Java version detection provides only
 * <code>isJavaV</code><i>x</i><code>OrLater</code> and not a generic
 * <code>getJavaVersion</code> to avoid any dependency in test code of
 * knowledge of the ordering of Java version numbers. Such an <code>int</code>
 * scheme is used internally, but not exposed except for self-tests.
 *
 * Methods named <code>has</code><i>X</i>, describing the presence of
 * specific features of the run-time environment, are to be preferred
 * over version-based methods. We don't have any of these yet, though.

     * Extracts the major version number from a Java version string.
     *
     * This is not part of the API of the class, but is available as
     * a protected method for self-testing.
     *
     * The version string given by the <code>java.version</code>
     * property has changed format multiple times in its history.
     * This method acts as a parser for such strings. It is only
     * required to handle versions of Java from the current platform
     * baseline onwards (and thus their particular version string
     * quirks) but in practice may support previous versions.
     *
     * For Java 6, 7 and 8, the version string has a format
     * like "1.X.0_123" where X is the version of Java. This means
     * that there will always be at least two components separated
     * by periods, and that the first such component will always
     * be "1".
     *
     * Examples of versions strings observed in practice:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li><code>1.6.0_65-b14-468</code>
     * <li><code>1.7.0_51</code>
     * <li><code>1.8.0_144</code>
     * </ul>
     *
     * For Java 9, the version string format is described in
     * <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/223">JEP 223</a>.
     *
     * For Java 10, the version string format is described in
     * <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/322">JEP 322</a>
     *
     * Both JEP 223 and JEP 322 allow for an arbitrary number of numeric
     * components separated by periods, but the possibility exists for this
     * to be a <em>single</em> component. Following this a number of other
     * components delimited by either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> may
     * appear. This means that version strings like "10+43" are possible, and
     * have been observed.
     *
     * @param versionStr version string to extract the version from
     * @return the major version number
     *
